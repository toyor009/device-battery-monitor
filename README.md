## 💡 Usage

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of battery health across all schools:

1. **Statistics Cards**: Overall dataset statistics for field team planning
2. **School Priority List**: Schools ordered by priority with expandable device details
3. **Filter Options**: View all schools, critical only, or schools needing immediate visits
4. **Device Details**: Click "Show Details" to see individual device information
5. **Data Management**: Pagination controls at the bottom for navigating large datasets with battery condition stats

### Understanding Device Status

- **🔴 Critical (Red)**: >30% daily battery usage - needs immediate replacement
- **🟡 Warning (Orange)**: 25-30% daily usage - monitor closely
- **🟢 Healthy (Green)**: <25% daily usage - normal operation
- **⚪ Unknown (Gray)**: Insufficient data points for reliable calculation

### Field Team Workflow

1. **Check Dashboard**: View overall statistics and school priorities
2. **Identify Priority Schools**: Focus on "High Priority" schools first
3. **Review Critical Devices**: Expand school details to see which devices need replacement
4. **Plan Visits**: Use the priority ranking to optimize travel routes

## 🧮 Battery Analysis Logic

### Calculation Methodology

The battery analysis uses a sophisticated weighted average approach that perfectly matches the problem requirements:

1. **Device-Level Grouping**: Data grouped by `serialNumber` (unique device identifier)
2. **Complete Dataset Analysis**: ALL data points for each device across the entire week are considered
3. **Chronological Processing**: Readings sorted by timestamp for accurate time-based calculations
4. **Charging Detection**: Automatically excludes periods where battery level increases

### Calculation Process

```typescript
// For each device (serialNumber)
const deviceReadings = groupBySerialNumber(allData);

// Sort readings chronologically
const sortedReadings = deviceReadings.sort(byTimestamp);

// Calculate consumption between consecutive readings
for (let i = 0; i < sortedReadings.length - 1; i++) {
  const current = sortedReadings[i];
  const next = sortedReadings[i + 1];

  const consumption = current.batteryLevel - next.batteryLevel;

  // Skip if battery level increased (charging)
  if (consumption <= 0) continue;

  const duration = (next.timestamp - current.timestamp) / (1000 * 60 * 60);

  totalConsumption += consumption;
  totalHours += duration;
}

// Calculate daily usage rate
const dailyUsageRate = (totalConsumption / totalHours) * 24;
```

### Status Classification

- **Critical**: >30% daily usage (needs replacement)
- **Warning**: 25-30% daily usage (monitor closely)
- **Healthy**: <25% daily usage (normal operation)
- **Unknown**: <2 data points (insufficient data)

### Key Features

- **Charging Detection**: Automatically excludes intervals where battery level increases
- **Duration Weighting**: Longer intervals have more influence on the average
- **Cross-Day Analysis**: Calculations span multiple days as required
- **Data Validation**: Handles edge cases like identical timestamps or invalid readings
- **School Prioritization**: Ranks schools by critical device count for efficient field visits

### Example Calculation

Given readings for a device:

- 9:00 AM - 100% battery
- 9:00 PM - 90% battery (12 hours, 10% consumption)
- 9:00 PM next day - 80% battery (24 hours, 10% consumption)

Calculation:

```
Interval 1: 10% over 12 hours = 20% daily rate
Interval 2: 10% over 24 hours = 10% daily rate
Weighted Average: (10% × 12 + 10% × 24) / (12 + 24) = 13.33% daily usage
Status: Healthy (< 25%)
```
